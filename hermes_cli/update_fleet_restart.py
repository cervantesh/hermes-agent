    The zero-rows fail-open (#93406): ``collect_fleet_versions()`` swallows
    every probe failure via ``logger.debug()`` and ``print_fleet_version_matrix([])``
    early-returns ``False``, so an empty snapshot reads as \"healthy fleet\" and
    the update exits 0.  An empty snapshot is only proof-of-safety when NOTHING
    says a gateway existed before the update.  Any of these signals means at
    least one runtime was (or may have been) live pre-update, so zero rows is
    verification failure, not health:

    * ``restarted_services`` / ``killed_pids`` — the POSIX restart phase
      touched live gateways.
    * ``pre_restart_pids`` non-empty, or ``None`` (pre-state unreadable —
      cannot prove nothing was running; same contract as
      ``_restart_phase_failure_is_incomplete``, #78574).
    * the pre-update plan inventoried ≥1 runtime.

    ``windows_resume_token`` is deliberately EXCLUDED (#93406 residual). The
    pause/resume token is bookkeeping for ``_pause_windows_gateways_for_update``
    / ``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update`` — it is not a runtime
    inventory, and its entries do not correspond to rows
    ``collect_fleet_versions()`` is capable of returning:

    * ``unmapped`` entries (Scheduled-Task gateways) never publish
      ``gateway_state.json`` rows at all, and
    * a paused profile gateway is resumed as a DETACHED relaunch that may not
      republish its identity within the probe window.

    Counting the token therefore made ``_fleet_rows_expected`` True on every
    Windows update that had paused a gateway, the probe's polling window ran
    out with zero rows on a perfectly healthy update, and verification
    reported "no rows … verification incomplete" and exited 1 after a long
    silent wait. Expected-runtimes must key only on signals that map to rows
    the probe can actually see; a genuinely live pre-update Windows gateway
    is already covered by ``pre_restart_pids`` and the plan inventory. The
    parameter stays in the signature so the call site keeps passing the token
    (cheap, explicit, and the docstring is where the exclusion is explained).

    The same condition gates the 2.0s settle sleep: a freshly restarted
    gateway needs the settle window to rewrite ``gateway_state.json``.

    Note this keys ONLY on zero-rows-despite-expected-runtimes.  A non-empty
    snapshot — including rows in ``unknown`` state — is still judged solely by
    ``print_fleet_version_matrix``.
