    The venv-holder guard refuses on the Desktop app's ``serve`` backend by
    design: while the Desktop is open, killing its backend is futile (the app
    supervises and respawns it within seconds), so the user must close the
    app. But in the GUI-updater handoff path the Desktop has *already
    exited* — by contract it tree-kills its backends and waits for the venv
    shim before spawning hermes-setup, and the update-in-progress marker
    parks any relaunched Desktop from spawning a fresh backend (#50238). A
    ``serve`` backend still holding the venv at that point is a straggler

      exists, or the PID was reused (parent created *after* the child).

    Tree-aware: the scanner can return an orphaned backend AND one of its
    managed-runtime descendants (the ``.hermes-runtime`` interpreter child)
    in the same holder set. That descendant has a live parent — the orphaned
    backend itself — and isn't a ``serve`` cmdline, so per-process rules
    would refuse a set that is entirely safe to reap. Holders that sit
    inside an accepted orphan root's tree are therefore folded into that
    root (only roots are returned; ``taskkill /T`` reaps the descendants).

    force-closed, and the half-done state stranded bot sessions.

    The hand-off is the safe signal: when the update-incomplete marker is
    present (the GUI updater claimed it) AND this is a ``--gateway`` hand-off
    run AND no live Desktop shim (``hermes.exe``) is open, NOTHING legitimate
    is supervising or respawning a ``serve`` backend from this venv — by the
    hand-off contract the Desktop tree-kills its backends and parks any
    relaunch behind the marker (#50238). Any ``serve`` backend still holding
    the venv here is therefore a leak, live parent or not, and reaping its
    tree is correct rather than a race.

    Guarded conservatively:

    - Only Hermes backends (``hermes_cli.main`` + ``serve``/``dashboard``)
      from THIS install's venv qualify; a non-backend holder (operator REPL,
      stray script) disqualifies the whole set → ``None`` (keep refusing), so
      we never widen the blast radius during a hand-off.
    - Only runs when the CALLER has confirmed the hand-off context
      (``args.gateway`` AND a claimed update-incomplete marker AND no live
      ``hermes.exe`` shim) — outside that gate this function is never called
      and the stricter orphan-only path stands.
    - psutil unavailable → ``None`` (can't re-read argv to classify → refuse).

    Returns the backend root PIDs to tree-reap, or ``None`` to leave the
    decision to the caller's existing rungs. Never raises.
