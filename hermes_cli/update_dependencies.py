    Mirrors the launcher block in ``scripts/install.sh`` so existing installs

    ``hermes-acp`` command name against the login-shell PATH; the console
    script of that name lives inside the install's venv, which is not on that

    ``acp`` subcommand, which makes it correct for every install layout
    (venv wrapper, FHS symlink, pipx/pip console script) without having to
    reconstruct interpreter/entrypoint paths.
