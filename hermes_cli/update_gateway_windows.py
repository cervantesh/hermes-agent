    Invoked from ``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update`` for the
    ``cold_start_if_installed`` case: no gateway was running when the update
    began, but an autostart entry (Scheduled Task / Startup-folder login item)
    is installed, signalling the user wants a gateway. Unlike the relaunch
    paths — which watch an old PID and respawn once it exits — this is a direct
    fresh spawn via the same hidden-console + breakaway path that
    ``hermes gateway start`` uses (``gateway_windows._spawn_detached``).

    Best-effort and idempotent: re-checks that nothing is running first so a
    concurrent start (e.g. the autostart entry firing) can't produce a
    duplicate gateway.

    A successful ``Popen`` only proves the process was created, not that it
    survived (e.g. a Windows job object denying breakaway kills it before it
    logs anything — #84185). So the success line is gated on the same
    post-spawn liveness poll every other ``_spawn_detached`` caller uses
    (``gateway_windows._report_gateway_start``), instead of being printed
    unconditionally from the returned PID.

    The Desktop GUI updater (``hermes-setup.exe``) executes
    ``$HERMES_HOME/bootstrap-cache/install-<ref>.ps1`` (or ``.sh``) for its
    repair/bootstrap stages. Installer binaries built before the #67193
    cache-refresh fix (June 2026 and earlier) NEVER re-download a cached
    branch-ref script — ``install-main.ps1`` cached at install time is
    reused forever, executing months-stale code with long-fixed bugs (the
    2026-08-09 incident: a June 4 cached script's venv stage lacked the
    #81327 process-tree sweep and died on ``Access denied``). The binary
    has no self-update path, so the poisoned cache outlives every
    ``hermes update``.

    Overwriting the cached script for *branch* with the freshly pulled
    ``scripts/install.ps1`` / ``scripts/install.sh`` on every update turns
    the stale binary's unconditional reuse into a feature: it "reuses" a
    file this function keeps permanently current. Post-#67193 installers
    re-download on each run anyway, so for them this is a harmless
    pre-seed of the same bytes.

    Scope guards, mirroring ``install_script.rs``:

    - Only the cache key for the update-target *branch* is rewritten
      (``sanitize_ref``: non ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]`` chars become ``_``, so
      ``bb/gui`` → ``install-bb_gui.ps1``). Sibling mutable refs cache
      DIFFERENT branches' scripts — updating main must not clobber
      ``install-bb_gui.ps1`` with main's script.
    - Commit-SHA pins are immutable by design and never touched. The
      installer's ``is_valid_commit()`` accepts **7–40** hex chars, so an
      abbreviated pin like ``install-4ce1994.ps1`` is just as immutable as
      a full 40-hex one; the sanitized *branch* is additionally required
      to not itself look like a commit pin (defense in depth against a
      caller passing a SHA as the branch).

    The .ps1 copy gets a UTF-8 BOM to match the installer's cache format
    (#67193 encoding fix). Best-effort: a failed refresh must never fail
    the update.
